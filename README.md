# uTox

Lightweight [Tox](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core) client.

* Some things are incomplete and there may be some bugs: feel free to make issues/suggestions

* Xlib support is mostly complete, but may have some small bugs (no right click menus, lags)

* Android support is experimental, it lacks important features (accepting/creating file transfers, sending inline images, video)
